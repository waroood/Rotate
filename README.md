# Rotate
Donation Application
An app for posting donations that is called "Rotate". The purpose of the app is to allow users to post items they would like to donate to others. Users would create a profile and then be able to upload pictures and a description of the items they would like to donate. They can specify what category the item falls under (e.g. clothing, electronics, furniture, etc.), and set the pickup location for their donation.
Other users can then browse through the posted items and when they find something they are interested in, they can contact the person who is offering the donation via an in-app messaging system. They can arrange a convenient time and place for pickup.
